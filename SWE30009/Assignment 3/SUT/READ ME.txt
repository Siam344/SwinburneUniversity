## Overview

This program is designed for performing **metamorphic testing** and **mutation testing** on a Bubble Sort algorithm. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of metamorphic relations (MR1 and MR2) in detecting faulty behavior across 30 non-equivalent mutants of the algorithm.

### Project Structure

- **Bubble_Sort_main Folder**: Contains the original GitHub source code used in this program (`bubble.py`).
- **MUTANTS Folder**: Contains 30 non-equivalent mutant versions of the Bubble Sort algorithm (`mutated_functions.py`).
- **TESTS Folder**: Contains the metamorphic test cases used for validating the functionality of the algorithm.(`metamorphic_tests.py`)
- **run_tests.py**: This script serves as the main program file that runs mutation testing and calculates the mutation score.

## How to Run the Program

### Step 1: Open the Project in VS Code

1. Open **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
2. Navigate to the **SUT** folder inside your project directory.

### Run Mutation Testing:

To evaluate the mutants through mutation testing:

1. Open the **SUT** folder in VS Code.
2. Execute the `run_tests.py` file:
   
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py


### Run Metamorphic Testing

To verify the metamorphic relations:

1.Inside the SUT folder, navigate to the TESTS folder.

2.Run the `metamorphic_tests.py` file:

     ```bash
  python TESTS/metamorphic_tests.py
